# PLANet-Plant-Leaf-Analyser-Network-
It is observed that a lot of crop gets wasted every year due to the illness spreading (reasons  can be pests, bacterial or fungal infections, etc.) in the farms. Farmers face huge losses  because of the lack of a handy and economical technology that can detect such diseases in  the initial stages of occurrence. This system can prove a remedy to this issue by developing a  prototype that recognizes the same at an early stage and thence providing them a way to  cure it using appropriate pesticides, insecticides, etc. �The aim is to build a deployable system for plants’ disease detection by training a Convolutional Neural  Network model that traces a particular disease in a particular plant species. It detects the  plant disease by scanning the leaves of the species as it is trained for those illness occurring on the leaves.Leaf plays a major role in providing important information related to the health of a plant. This method is based on a technique that scans the leaf sample of the infected plant. These scanned samples will then be processed and the model will be trained to classify the diseases  accordingly�. �
